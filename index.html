        <h1> About</h1>
            <div class="line"></div>
            <p>My favorite hobby is hand sewing. Hand sewing is almost the same thing as using a sewing machine, but you would only use a needle, thread, and fabric or felt on whatever you are working on. I have learned this 3 months ago, when my elective changed at school. 
            
            My teacher taught us sewing by teaching the many stiches beasue that's how you will learn how to make pillows (I am such an expert at pillows that I have 6 made at my house), stuff toys, pencil holder, etc. 
                
            The three stiches I learned were the running stich, embroidery stich, and the overcast. You only need to learn that much to make the many common furniture and stuff toys by yourself, but you can't make blankets because they require another stic called the blanket stich, which I don't know as of now. 
            
            <br/> <br/> My journey started when our teacher was handing out sewing supplies. She explained in detail what every single component is, given the materials we had. She instructed us how to thread a needle, which is putting the thread inside the needle and making a knot to have a loop shape. Then, she explained more things (things that you will see in tips) and taught us how to do the three stiches I mentioned about. I followed along and as I practiced, I felt more relaxed, calm, and also an expert at this.</p>
